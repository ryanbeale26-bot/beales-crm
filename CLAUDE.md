# CLAUDE.md — Beale's LLC CRM

Persistent context for Claude Code sessions in this repo. **Keep this file updated.** At the end of every phase, update "Current Status," add anything learned to "Decision Log," and resolve items in "Open Questions." A future session should be able to read only this file and be productive.

## What this is

An internal CRM for the 5-person senior leadership team at Beale's LLC, a family-owned commercial facility services company outside Boston (~150 employees, ~50 buildings across Greater Boston / New England, founded 1986). It replaces a Google Sheet that only Ryan maintains.

The four jobs it must do:

1. Track daily activity inside accounts (calls, site visits, complaints, wins)
2. Track staff movement and completed project work at each building
3. Manage opportunities — creation, stage progression, closed-won, closed-lost
4. Report on revenue growth, account expansion, and account/opportunity losses

**The adoption bar governs every design decision.** This team has never used a CRM. If the app is harder than the spreadsheet, they won't use it and the project fails. Logging an activity must take under 20 seconds on a phone. Required fields are the enemy.

## Who uses it

Five people, invite-only, no public signup. All five see all data.

| Name | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Ryan Beale | Admin | Managing Director, the developer of this app |
| Jon Beale | Leadership | Owner/President, Ryan's father |
| Robert Milligan | Leadership | |
| Bob Mulligan | Leadership | **Distinct person from Robert Milligan — do not dedupe** |
| Victor Melo | Leadership / field | Site supervisor |

Non-admins have full read/write on accounts, buildings, contacts, activities, opportunities, projects, and employees. Admins additionally manage users, reference data, and imports.

## Who Ryan is, and how to work with him

Not a professional developer. Has shipped one real app (InspectQA) using Claude Code, so he can read code, run terminal commands, and debug with guidance — but explain things in plain English.

- Plan before building. Propose, then wait for confirmation.
- One phase at a time. End each phase by telling him exactly what to test in the browser, then stop.
- Explain terminal commands before he runs them, and say what success looks like.
- Commit at every phase with plain-English messages.
- Never invent business data — real building names, contract values, team workflows. Ask.
- Push back when a request will hurt performance, maintainability, or adoption.

## Stack

- **Next.js** (App Router) + **TypeScript**
- **Supabase** — Postgres, Auth, RLS on every table, Storage
- **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui**
- **Recharts**
- **Vercel** (Ryan has Pro)

Rules:
- Secrets in `.env.local` and Vercel env vars only. **The service role key never reaches client-side code.**
- Every table ships with RLS enabled and an explicit authenticated-user policy. No exceptions.
- Revenue math lives in **Postgres views or SQL functions**, never in React. One source of truth for "what is MRR."
- No `localStorage` for application data.
- Seed script with realistic fake records so screens are never empty in development.

## Architecture decisions already made

**1. Account vs. Building split.** An *account* is a customer relationship; a *building* is a serviced site. One account, many buildings. Contract value, square footage, scope, staffing, pay rates, and bill rates all live on the **building** and roll up to the account. This lets Beale's lose one building in a portfolio without losing the account, and makes revenue reporting correct.

**2. Separate Supabase project from InspectQA.** InspectQA (project `kbqivepqykccdyexgnhu`) is live in client environments — South Shore Health and Dana-Farber — and is being prepared as a standalone SaaS spinout. CRM migrations must not be able to touch it, and its schema must stay cleanly separable for technical diligence. The CRM reads InspectQA across the project boundary via a read-only role and mirrors the data locally.

**3. InspectQA is read-only and authoritative for inspections and work orders.** Never write to it. Never rebuild inspection or work-order creation in the CRM. CRM queries always read the local mirror tables, so InspectQA being down never breaks the CRM.

**4. Two operating entities.** Beale's LLC (non-union) and Assurance Facility Services / AFS (workplace-organization signatory). Buildings carry an `entity` field so revenue reports split cleanly.

**5. Paychex has no usable API.** Do not attempt one. Payroll data enters via weekly email ingest into reviewable `staffing_reports` rows, plus manual pay-rate fields.

**6. Integrations come last.** Nothing before the core app is in daily use with real data. Order: InspectQA → payroll email ingest → Gmail/Outlook → Granola → Claude API summaries.

**7. `employee_assignments` is load-bearing.** The employee↔building join carries hours, pay rate, and bill rate. It is the source of labor margin per building *and* the source of truth for staff movement — an assignment ending plus another beginning is a move.

**8. Audit log.** Five people editing shared records; track who changed what and when.

## Migration source: Ryan's Google Sheet

Six tabs, the source of truth for all existing data. **Ask for actual headers of the specific tab you need, at the phase you need it. Never design an importer from imagination.**

| Tab | Becomes | Phase |
|---|---|---|
| `0-Dashboard` | Metrics Ryan already watches → drives dashboard design | 5 |
| `1-Pipeline` | `opportunities` | 3 |
| `2-Active Clients` | `accounts` + `buildings` | 1 |
| `3-Contact Directory` | `contacts` + contact↔building links | 1 |
| `4-Activity Log` | `activities` | 2 |
| `5-Won/Loss Analysis` | Closed-won/lost history, loss reasons, competitors | 3 |

**`2-Active Clients` is one row per building, not per account.** A customer with twelve buildings appears twelve times, and the accounts layer does not exist anywhere yet. The importer must derive accounts by grouping rows on customer name, then attach each row as a building. Names will be spelled inconsistently ("Healthcare Realty" vs. "Healthcare Realty Trust"), so the preview must show proposed account groupings and let Ryan merge them by hand before writing.

Build the importer as a reusable admin screen — upload CSV → map columns → preview → confirm. Data will be re-imported and corrected several times.

## Phase plan

Accounts and activity logging first; pipeline next. Ship Phases 1–6 as a working product before touching any integration.

- [ ] **Phase 0** — Scaffold, this file, proposed schema, open questions
- [ ] **Phase 1** — Auth + five users. Full schema built now. UI: accounts, buildings, contacts CRUD, account detail page with tabs, CSV importer. Migrate tabs 2 and 3.
- [ ] **Phase 2** — Quick-add activity logging, timelines, activity feed with filters. Migrate tab 4. *This is the daily-habit feature — the whole project rests on it.*
- [ ] **Phase 3** — Opportunities kanban, stage history, weighted pipeline, closed-lost capture, closed-won conversion to account + building, pipeline report. Migrate tabs 1 and 5.
- [ ] **Phase 4** — Employees, assignments, staff movement history, projects
- [ ] **Phase 5** — Revenue views in Postgres, dashboard (mirror tab 0 first), six reports with CSV export
- [ ] **Phase 6** — Mobile polish, global search (Cmd-K), audit log, empty states, error handling, invite the team
- [ ] **Phase 7+** — Integrations, one per phase, in the order above

## Current status

**Phase:** 0 — not started
**Last session:** —
**Next action:** Propose schema for Ryan's review; ask the Phase 0 questions.

## Non-goals

- No public signup, marketing site, billing, or subscriptions. Internal tool, five users.
- No native mobile app. Responsive web; installable PWA is fine.
- No inspection or work-order creation — InspectQA owns that.
- No invoicing or accounting — QuickBooks owns that. Contract and project values here are for reporting only.
- No multi-tenant architecture. One company. (But keep the `entity` field on buildings.)

---

## Open questions

- [ ] Deal stage names — the six in the spec are a starting point, not a decision. Ask at the start of Phase 3 and derive candidates from the stage column in tab `1-Pipeline`.
- [ ] Exact column headers for each sheet tab — ask per phase.
- [ ] Sender email addresses for the weekly payroll emails from Victor Melo, Robert Milligan, and Bob Mulligan.
- [ ] InspectQA schema and read-only credentials — Ryan provides at Phase 7.
- [ ] `0-Dashboard` formulas or screenshot — needed before designing the Phase 5 dashboard.

## Decision log

| Date | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| — | Separate Supabase project from InspectQA | Spinout separability + protecting a live client-facing app from CRM migrations |
| — | Building-level contract and rate data, accounts as a rollup | Correct revenue reporting; can lose a building without losing the account |
| — | Accounts + activity logging before pipeline | Activity logging is the habit everything downstream depends on |
